# A guide to LPCI-1

The Linux Professional Institute has a number of Linux ceretificates for professionals.

Using their objectives list for LPIC-1 [101](http://www.lpi.org/our-certifications/exam-101-objectives) and [102](http://www.lpi.org/our-certifications/exam-102-objectives) of the Aministartive certifacte, this takes those objectives and links it to freely available information plus my own work.

My intention is to teach myself, and provide some guidance to others.

> The world’s largest and most recognized Linux Certification. LPIC-1 is the first certification in LPI’s multi-level Linux professional certification program. The LPIC-1 will validate the candidate's ability to perform maintenance tasks on the command line, install and configure a computer running Linux and configure basic networking. The LPIC-1 is designed to reflect current research and validate a candidate's proficiency in real world system administration. The objectives are tied to real-world job skills, which we determine through job task analysis surveying during exam development.
